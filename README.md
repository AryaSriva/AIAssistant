Fun little AI Project, basically implementing an Assistant web application using the OpenAI Api

How to run:
Type py app.py in terminal
You need your own .env file with a variable called GITHUB_TOKEN with your github token.

What's next?

I want to make it so you can switch between different models(ie Go from using GPT-4 to Ollama 3.2 or Claude)
